[HelloSMS](https://hellotext.com) is an awesome app with a design concept that I like very much ! So I wanted to know how to create the same menu and after some digging I found a way to do it. It was a little bit difficult so I explained [here](http://blog.robinchutaux.com/blog/how-to-create-a-menu-like-hello-sms/) how to achieve the same menu with interaction.
